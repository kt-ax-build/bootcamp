# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

As members of the AI Agentic Bootcamp community, we pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:

* Showing empathy and kindness toward other people and perspectives
* Giving and receiving constructive feedback with courtesy
* Taking responsibility for mistakes, apologizing, and learning from them
* Focusing on what is best not just for individuals, but for the overall community
* Creating an inclusive space for learning and growth
* Welcoming and supporting learners from diverse backgrounds and experience levels

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* Intentionally disrupting or hindering others' learning experiences

## Responsibilities of Community Leaders

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct. They will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project or community in public spaces. Examples include using an official project email address, posting via official social media accounts, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Additional Guidelines for Educational Environments

### As a Learner

* **Don't be afraid to ask questions** – no question is too basic
* **Support your fellow learners** – sharing knowledge benefits everyone
* **Learn from mistakes** – errors are a natural part of the learning process
* **Offer constructive feedback** – focus on suggestions for improvement, not criticism

### As an Instructor or Mentor

* **Be patient** – learners progress at different paces
* **Use inclusive language** – help everyone feel welcome regardless of background
* **Recognize different learning styles** – support diverse approaches to learning
* **Encourage a growth mindset** – frame challenges as opportunities for growth

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders at \[[noisonnoiton@gmail.com](mailto:noisonnoiton@gmail.com)]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and safety of those who report incidents.
